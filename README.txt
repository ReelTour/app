I changed room boxes to accept onclick event, it should solve the
problem of running video every time you scroll down.
I tried to debug the problem with photo preview, but it works all the time.
I cannot repeat the problem you have, I will continue trying, but
please try to get logs (using app like logcat extreme, as I wrote before, or adb).
Also try to run this new version I tried to put some fixes maybe it will solve the problem.
I also checked the pdf you sent me and started working on it a little bit.
I will need a logo with higher resolution.
If you don't mind I will change all layouts for landscape and portrait for 30$.
If you don't mind it would be better to pay directly on paypal, 
cuz fiverr is too gready, they are eating 20% of money.
My paypal is

Good luck and thanks
